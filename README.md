# Overview

This is the first working configuration for the Dell XPS 9500 with working S4 hibernate/resume. S3 seems to be elusive (for now) but S4 works seamlessly and honestly it's a much more practical option as the machine shuts down and then resumes seamlessly on power on.

# BIOS Settings

| Setting | Option |
| --- | --- |
| SATA Operation | AHCI |
| Fast Boot | Thorough |
| Secure Boot | Disabled |
| TMP 2.0 Security | Disabled |
| Intel SGX | Disabled |
| VT for Direct I/O | Disabled |
| Fingerprint Reader | Disabled |

# S4 ACPI
Despite Dell's attempts to sabotage S3 sleep, I've managed to get S4 sleep 
(hibernatemode 25) on macOS, uusing a combination of IFR edits 
and ACPI table changes. The first step is to change the following 
variables from the UEFI interface using modGRUBshell:

```bash
setup_var PchSetup 0x16 00 (RTC Memory Lock ->Disabled)
setup_var CpuSetup 0x3E 00 (CFG Lock ->Disabled)
```

# Known Issues

- None as far as I know...
